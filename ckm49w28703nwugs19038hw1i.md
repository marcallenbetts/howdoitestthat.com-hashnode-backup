## mitmproxy cheat sheet


I use [Charles Proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/) pretty much nonstop when testing. As a backup I use [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/). It lacks a bit of the polished UI that Charles provides, but it is free and open source. And it gets cool points for being a command line tool.

These notes cover only a fraction of what mitmproxy can do, but is pretty much everything I need most days.

### Install

```
brew install mitmproxy
```

### Help

```
mitmproxy --help
```

### Start proxy on port 8989

```
mitmproxy --listen-port 8989 --ssl-insecure
--set console_mouse=false
```

The `ssl-insecure` flag ignores insecure SSL sites, which is common in
a lot of the test environments I use. The `console_mouse` option makes it
easier to copy/paste output from the terminal.

### Start reverse proxy on port 8989 that directs traffic to port 4001

```
mitmproxy —-listen-port 8989 —-ssl-insecure
-—set console_mouse=false
-—mode reverse:http://localhost:4001
```

### Navigation

- `j`/`k`: down/up
- `enter`: select request
- `q`: back/quit
- `z`: clear requests
